# standard-homeware
A library of functional 3D models, carefully designed for 3D printing according to [our best practices](styleguide.md). Every item is easy to print, and works as expected.

### Sets

The original Animal Crossing game had dozens of furniture sets, eash with a bed, couch, chair, dresser etc. This project is that, but for small, functional 3D printed items that you can use around the house. At first, the sets will be pretty basic, mostly consisting of the Vanilla set with cool or cute patterns. Later, I'd like sets that combine CAD modeling and Sculpting. Here are some of the planned sets:
- **Vanilla**: The template set for the other sets
- **Honeybee**: Hexagons up in this hive
- **Geometric**: Hope you like kaleidoscopes
- **Woodcraft**: For that handmade look. Wood filament optional.
- **Art Deco**: Matches your grammaphone
- Submit your ideas!

### Best Practices
- Repeatability: Parts print easily on all 3D printers, and look great on high end machines.
- Safety: Nobody gets hurt. Wall-mounted objects will standardized mounting systems. Don't shoot your eye out.
- Sustainability: Designs use minimal material while being durable.
  
### Part Naming
The name is a combination of the these attributes.
1. Design Set: Flowery
2. Housezone: Desktop
3. Type: Pencil Cup
4. Size: S/M/L/XL, or A/B/C for variants.
5. Version: v0.1
6. Unique Catalog Number. I'm not sure on the format, or how much of it should be human readable. A01-01XL-v0.1
Example: Flowery Desktop Pencil Cup, Small - v1.1 (a3E-G900)

### Data on printing page
- Title

# Behind the Scenes
This is where I sketch out ideas for the projects. Don't tell anyone.

### Idea Scratchpad (until this is mature enough for feature requests)
- Can you mix and match items from different sets, such as a drawer from one set can go in the organizer from another.
- Needs to be a comment system. Send github feature requests in some cases.
- Objects include a logo or brand stamp on the bottom?
- Parametric via modularity. Puzzle Pieces
- Pseodo-parametric. People don't need to customize if they don't want to; they just pick a size that works.
- Visual catalog. The big style grid with parts on one axis and sets on the other.

### Buzzword Bank
The name of this project is not finalized, so in this place I'll list relevant words that could be used to describe the project. Mix and Match, Categories. Choose your function and style. homewares. organized. catalog of standard homewares. form and function. Good 3D Household Goods and Decor. essentials and accessories, Free Things, Buy My Stuff

### About the Project
All models in this project are made with free and open source software:
- **FreeCAD** for parametric dimensioned designs
- **Blender** for freeform designs
- **Inkscape** for 2D vector drawings
- **OpenSCAD** for making parts with math
- **SculptGL**, SkulptFab, and other open source tools
