You know how Animal Crossings has sets of furniture, and each set has a different theme? This is that, but for smaller functional 3D printed items. That you use around the house. A set may include some of the following items:

- Plant thing
- Pencil Cup
- Tool caddy
- Charging station
- Drawer organizers
- Business card holder
- Bookends
- Tissue boxes
- Doilies
- Headphone stand
- Keyboard wristpad?
- Tabletop organizers and drawers
- Rolltop desk drawers, but lots of styles. Modern
- Organizers for bookshelves
- Wall Mounted
  - Picture Frames
  - Paper holders
- Modren electronic compatible. Paper is the new pager.

I'm planning to update this in the future with a actual 3D models, specific plans, organization, best practices. Etc. I've been designing for 3D printing as a full time job for the past few years.

I literally need a brand. An icon that I can stamp on objects. What sort of setup making something easily mountable. I need a list of options, trying to find one that's balanced, given the weight limitations. Are there government safety standards for wall hanging?
