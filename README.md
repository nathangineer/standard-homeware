# standard-homeware
A library of functional 3D models, carefully designed for 3D printing according to our best practices. Every item is easy to print, and works as expected.

## Sets

The original Animal Crossing game had dozens of furniture sets, eash with a bed, couch, chair, dresser etc. This project is that, but for small, functional 3D printed items that you can use around the house. You can go with a basic functional versions, or you can get fancy. Here are some of the planned sets:
- **Vanilla**: This bare bones set acts as a template set for all the others. Might have some rounded corners, as a treat.
- **Minimal Material**
- **Easy to print** - Contiguous layers, if possible.
- Print for life
- Sample - Skeleton version for testing size. like a two layer picture frame. or the front couple layers of a drawer. Or scaffolding for a box.
- Geometric - Hope you like triangles
- Roll-top Desk
- Art Deco
- 60s
- Forest
- See-through vs opaque sets. Even the vanilla set might have a see-thru vairant.
- Submit your idea as an Issue!

## Best Practices
- Repeatability - Parts print easily on all 3D printers, and look great on high end machines.
- Safety - Nobody gets hurt. Wall-mounted objects will standardized mounting systems. Don't shoot your eye out.
- Sustainability - Designs use minimal material while being durable. 


# Behind the Scenes
This is where I sketch out ideas for the projects. Don't tell anyone.

## What do we call the project?
Free Things
Buy My Stuff

## Part Naming
The name is a combination of the these attributes.
1. Set: Flowery
2. Housezone: Desktop
3. Type: Cup
4. Size: S/M/L/XL, or A/B/C for variants.
5. Version: v0.1
6. Catalog Number: Not human readable? Or 8 character limit?
Example: Flowery Desktop Cup, Small - v1.1 (a3E-G900)

## Catalog Number

VA01-01XL-v0.1 s456
## Data on printing page
1. Title
2. Good photos
3. Color Preview with color swap
4. 
9. Weight
10. Required 3D printer dimensions / compatible printers


## Idea Scratchpad (until this is mature enough for feature requests)
- You can mix and match items from different sets, such as a drawer from one set can go in the organizer from another.
- Needs to be a comment system. Send github feature requests in some cases.
- Every object has a version for smaller printers
- What sort of setup making something easily mountable. I need a list of options, trying to find one that's balanced, given the weight limitations. Are there government safety standards for wall hanging?
- Objects include a logo or brand stamp in an unobtrusive location
- Printing suggestions for each part
- Each

## Buzzword Bank
The name of this project is not finalized, so in this place I'll list relevant words that could be used to describe the project. Mix and Match, Categories. Choose your function and style. homewares. organized. catalog of standard homewares. form and function. Good 3D Household Goods and Decor. essentials and accessories

## Unsorted ideas
People can submit new sizes 
Parametric via modularity. 
Pseodo-parametric. People don't need to customize if they don't want to; they just pick a size that works.
Visual catalog with item numbers. 002-03 means item 2, set 3. What about variants?

## Me
I've been using CAD software for 20 years, and I've spend the last five years 3D printing as my full time job. So I'm alright at it.
