# standard-homeware
A library of functional 3D models, carefully designed for 3D printing according to our best practices. Every item is easy to print, and works as expected.

## Elevator Pitch
The original Animal Crossing game had dozens of furniture sets, eash with a bed, couch, chair, dresser etc. This project is that, but for small, functional 3D printed items that you can use around the house. I've been using CAD software for 20 years, and I've spend the last five years 3D printing as my full time job. So I'm alright at it.

## Sets
- Vanilla - This bare bones set acts as a template set for all the others. Might have some rounded corners, as a treat.
- Geometric
- Roll-top desk
- Art Deco
- 60s
- Forest
- See-through vs opaque sets. Even the vanilla set might have a see-thru vairant.

## Objects
- Plant thing
- Pencil cup
- Tool caddy
- Charging station
- Drawer organizers (Mezzanine shelf)
- Business card holder
- Bookends
- Tissue boxes
- Doilies
- Headphone stand
- Keyboard wristpad?
- Tabletop organizers and drawers
- Rolltop desk drawers, but lots of styles. Modern
- Organizers for bookshelves
- Wall Mounted
  - Picture Frames
  - Paper holders
- Modren electronic compatible. Paper is the new pager.

## Best Practices
- Repeatability - Parts work even on low-end printers, due to careful tolerancing standards.
- Safety - Nobody gets hurt. Wall-mounted objects will standardized mounting systems. Don't shoot your eye out.
- You can sort by compatible printer
- Every object has a version for smaller printers
- What sort of setup making something easily mountable. I need a list of options, trying to find one that's balanced, given the weight limitations. Are there government safety standards for wall hanging?
- Objects include a logo or brand stamp in an unobtrusive location

You can mix and match items from different sets, such as a drawer from one set can go in the organizer from another.

## Buzzword Bank
The name of this project is not finalized, so in this place I'll list relevant words that could be used to describe the project. Mix and Match, Categories. Choose your function and style. I need to solidify some terminology too. Each part has size/configuration variants, and style variants. What do I call those? I could call each style a "set" which implies that it includes other parts. I think people intuitive understand the furniture sets in Animal Crossing
