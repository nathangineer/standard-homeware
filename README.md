# standard-homeware
A library of functional 3D models, carefully designed for 3D printing according to our best practices. Every item is easy to print, and works as expected.

## Elevator Pitch
The original Animal Crossing game had dozens of furniture sets, eash with a bed, couch, chair, dresser etc. This project is that, but for small, functional 3D printed items that you can use around the house. I've been using CAD software for 20 years, and I've spend the last five years 3D printing as my full time job. I've decided to try to give back. Hope you like it.

## Objects
- Plant thing
- Pencil Cup
- Tool caddy
- Charging station
- Drawer organizers
- Business card holder
- Bookends
- Tissue boxes
- Doilies
- Headphone stand
- Keyboard wristpad?
- Tabletop organizers and drawers
- Rolltop desk drawers, but lots of styles. Modern
- Organizers for bookshelves
- Wall Mounted
  - Picture Frames
  - Paper holders
- Modren electronic compatible. Paper is the new pager.

## Best Practices
- You can sort by compatible printer
- Every object has a version for smaller printers
- What sort of setup making something easily mountable. I need a list of options, trying to find one that's balanced, given the weight limitations. Are there government safety standards for wall hanging?
- Objects include a logo or brand stamp in an unobtrusive location

You can mix and match items from different sets, such as a drawer from one set can go in the organizer from another.


## Buzzword Bank
The name of this project is not finalized, so in this place I'll list relevant words that could be used to describe the project. Mix and Match, Categories. Choose your function and style. I need to solidify some terminology too. Each part has size/configuration variants, and style variants. What do I call those? I could call each style a "set" which implies that it includes other parts. I think people intuitive understand the furniture sets in Animal Crossing
