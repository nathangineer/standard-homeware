# standard-homeware
A library of functional 3D models, carefully designed for 3D printing according to our best practices. Every item is easy to print, and works as expected.

### Sets

The original Animal Crossing game had dozens of furniture sets, eash with a bed, couch, chair, dresser etc. This project is that, but for small, functional 3D printed items that you can use around the house. You can go with a basic functional versions, or you can get fancy. Here are some of the planned sets:
- **Vanilla**: This bare bones set acts as a template set for all the others. Might have some rounded corners, as a treat.
- **Minimal Material**
- **Easy to print** - Contiguous layers, if possible.
- Sample - Skeleton version for testing size. like a two layer picture frame. or the front couple layers of a drawer. Or scaffolding for a box. Not functional except for helping you visualize the object
- Geometric - Hope you like triangles
- Roll-top Desk
- Art Deco
- 60s
- Forest
- See-through vs opaque sets. Even the vanilla set might have a see-thru vairant.
- Submit your idea as an Issue!

### Best Practices
Add a link here.standard-homeware [is this link?](styleguide.md)
- Repeatability - Parts print easily on all 3D printers, and look great on high end machines.
- Safety - Nobody gets hurt. Wall-mounted objects will standardized mounting systems. Don't shoot your eye out.
- Sustainability - Designs use minimal material while being durable. 


### Part Naming
The name is a combination of the these attributes.
1. Design Set: Flowery
2. Housezone: Desktop
3. Type: Pencil Cup
4. Size: S/M/L/XL, or A/B/C for variants.
5. Version: v0.1
6. Unique Catalog Number. I'm not sure on the format, or how much of it should be human readable. A01-01XL-v0.1
Example: Flowery Desktop Pencil Cup, Small - v1.1 (a3E-G900)

### Data on printing page
- Title

# Behind the Scenes
This is where I sketch out ideas for the projects. Don't tell anyone.

## Idea Scratchpad (until this is mature enough for feature requests)
- Can you mix and match items from different sets, such as a drawer from one set can go in the organizer from another.
- Needs to be a comment system. Send github feature requests in some cases.
- Objects include a logo or brand stamp on the bottom?
- Parametric via modularity. 
- Pseodo-parametric. People don't need to customize if they don't want to; they just pick a size that works.
- Visual catalog. The big style grid with parts on one axis and sets on the other.

## Buzzword Bank
The name of this project is not finalized, so in this place I'll list relevant words that could be used to describe the project. Mix and Match, Categories. Choose your function and style. homewares. organized. catalog of standard homewares. form and function. Good 3D Household Goods and Decor. essentials and accessories, Free Things, Buy My Stuff

## Unsorted ideas


## Me
I've been using CAD software for 20 years, and I've spend the last five years 3D printing as my full time job. So I'm alright at it.
