You know how Animal Crossings has sets of furniture, and each set has a different theme? This is that, but for smaller functional 3D printed items. That you use around the house. A set may include some of the following items:

- Office
  - Plant thing
  - Pencil Cup
  - Drawer organizers
  - Business card holder
  - Bookends
  - Headphone stand
  - Keyboard wristpad?
  - Tabletop organizers and drawers
    - Rolltop desk drawers, but lots of styles. Modern
  - Organizers for bookshelves
  - Wall Mounted
    - Picture Frames
    - Paper holders
- Kitchen

I'm planning to update this in the future with a actual 3D models, specific plans, organization, best practices. Etc. I've been designing for 3D printing as a full time job for the past few years.
