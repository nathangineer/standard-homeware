# Style Guide (v0.1)
The goal of this project is to create a catalog with /consistency/. Everything consistently prints easily and works like you expect. Parts within a set have a consistent style. Hangables have consistent hanging options. 

This style guide is a draft of a plan to make a style guide. Maybe I'll start with some axioms, because those look cool, but the rest will not look so cool for now.

## Outline
Sets have consistent styles
Parts have consistent function across styles 
Parts can have part specific best practices
Styles have style specific best practices
Zones can have zone specific best practices? Is this making it too complicated? Why would zone specific categories be needed? They're just an attribute for sorting
The big table. Axis for set and part.
